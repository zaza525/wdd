				<p class="body-header">Question 1: Transition and Pseudoselectors</p>
				<p>Remember pseudoselectors? In this problem, we'll be adding pseudoselectors to the button class so they'll animate when hovered over.
				<br />
				<br />
				Add code so that, when hovered over, the buttons rotate 180 degrees, have full opacity, and become a circle. These changes should be smooth (we're animating, after all!) and take 0.45 seconds. See the video below for the final result.</p>

				<p class="body-header">Question 2: Keyframes and Animations</p>
				<p></p>


				<p>In this part, we'll be working with keyframes, which give us more control over the animations with how they execute, how long they execute for, etc. We'll be animating a basketball to bounce up and down infinitely, as seen below:</p>
				<video width="660" controls>
  					<source src="assets/images/q2.mov" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Part 1: Create a keyframe animation for the ball bounce. The ball should <code>translate</code> from its starting Y value of <code>-200px</code> to <code>30px</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 2: Create a keyframe animation for the shadow change. The shadow should grow smaller when the ball is closer to the ground, and <code>scale</code> to half its original size. Additionally, the opacity should change from its initial value of <code>0.5</code> to <code>0.6</code>, as shadows get darker when closer to the ground.
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 3: Add both of these keyframes to their respective ids in the CSS. The staff solution takes roughly 0.45 seconds with a timing-function of <code>cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.7, 0.5)</code>, has no delay, repeats infinitely, and alternates (go forward and back). However, there is more than one way to animate; go with whatever keyframe combination/animation options makes most sense to you!
					</li>
